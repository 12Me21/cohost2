🔸🔶🟧 BROWSER EXTENSION 🟧🔶🔸

• This is a temporary hack to allow the site to:
  ◦ make cross-origin requests to cohost.org
  ◦ read/write cookie headers in those requests

• install ./extension/manifest.json as a temporary add-on, at about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox

• currently only supports firefox (could work in chrome/edge with minor changes)
